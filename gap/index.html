<h1>My Gap</h1>
<div class="col-2">
  <blockquote>A radio that doesn't look like a piece of "electronics" that fits the calm and minimal aesthetic of my bedroom</blockquote>

  <p>I haven't bought a radio for my bedroom since everything on the market is either too big or looks like electronics. I want to make something more subtle.</p>

  <p>I have found 5 people who also have this gap: my boyfriend, housemate, colleagues at work and friends.</p>

  <p>I have experimented with a low-powered computer that can play live radio streams. To address the gap I need to build a case for the hardware and some way of controlling it.</p>

  <p>I'm very interested in the intersection between physical products that are connected and networked in some way with novel user interfaces.</p>
