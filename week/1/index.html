    <p>The well-designed artifact is this wallet. It's made of leather which is soft and tactile to hold. The elastic band is both functional, since it keeps the wallet closed securely and aesthetically pleasing due to its mustard contrast colour and texture.</p>
    <p>The four card slots each hold a single card, this constraint ensures that I can't carry too many cards which would make the wallet bulky.</p>
    <p>The break in the band at the back means that I always know which  side my transport card is which helps when scanning it through the readers at the train station.</p>

  <h2>Assignment #1.2: Find the gap</h2>
  <ol class="col-1">
    <li>A way of getting the shower at my preferred temperature each morning without having to fiddle with the hot and cold taps</li>
    <li>A radio that doesn't look like a piece of "electronics" that fits the calm and minimal aesthetic of my bedroom</li>
    <li>A way of finding out when I should leave the house to catch the next train at the station since I hate just missing one</li>
    <li>A service that tells me what I have in the fridge today and what I could make for my dinner</li>
    <li>A way of finding out who's going to be in my office tomorrow and whether I should work from home</li>
    <li>A service that tells me what time everyone will arrive at work today so I know if I should but coffees on the way in</li>
    <li>A solution for organising my desk and papers so I know where to find all the projects I work on</li>
    <li>An app that encourages me to eat breakfast in the morning, or at least tells me where on my journey I can get it</li>
    <li>A rigid but compact bag so I can carry any half-built electronics projects around. The bag should be able to fold flat when I'm done with it.</li>
    <li>An alarm clock that reminds me of when my friends birthdays are, a week ahead of time so I can send them a card</li>
